# Airborne-Vehicle-Health-Parameter-Monitoring-System
This is Project Based on the Real-Time Monitoring System which uses the GLG Toolkit Libraray.
For this project to work on your computer, you need to install the community edition of "GLG Toolkit" from the the "genlogic" website.
After installation, first thing you have to do is to set the classpath to the system variable.
