# Airborne-Vehicle-Health-Parameter-Monitoring-System
This is Project Based on the Real-Time Monitoring System which uses the GLG Toolkit Libraray and programming was done through VS Code.
In this project we have to receive inputs from a file from UDP Program which will be the health parameters and show it to the meters, gauge, and Graph. 
For this project to work on your computer, you need to install the community edition of "GLG Toolkit" from the the "genlogic" website.
After installation, first thing you have to do is to set the classpath to the system variable in your system environment.
".\GlgCE.jar;.\GlgDemo.jar;"- copy this same and create a new variable "CLASSPATH" and paste it.
"GlgCE.jar"- It will help in running all program that you will build using GLG Toolkit library.
"GlgDemo.jar"- It will help in running demo program for java.
After setting class path you need to create ".g" extension file that will represent the Diagram file or GUI for the program.
".g" extension file can we created manually like other file or you can go through programming how to create it.
Now you can do the programming as per your requirement.
